# ML_Project
We try to predict contraceptive method choise using Tree and SVM algorithms.
Our repository has the following contents:
* a short description of your data
  * 2d plot with tSNE
* a mathematical overview of the two ML methods used
* a description of your fitting process including
  * a summary of how you arrived at your final model
  * the choice of hyperparameters and how made this choice
* an appropriate assessment of the predicted values and a fair comparison of the two methods
* appropriate graphical presentation
